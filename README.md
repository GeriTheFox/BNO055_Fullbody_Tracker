# BNO055_Fullbody_Tracker
 Based on the [SlimeVR](https://github.com/SlimeVR/) project
 
## THis project was work in prograss, build with your own risk.

The pcb based on the [BNO055](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf) Sensor, and the [ESP8266-12F](https://docs.ai-thinker.com/_media/esp8266/docs/esp-12f_product_specification_en.pdf). Designed in the open source [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) software.

The design should be compatibile with the original [limeVR-Tracker-ESP](https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP) project.

The only reason this project exist cuz i got a bunch of BNO055 from a university, so i decied to make something useful lookinng from it.
